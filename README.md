## Project Highlights

- 🔁 **Shortest Path Finder:** Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the minimum number of stations.
- 🔄 **Minimum Line Exchange Path:** Uses Modified Dijkstra's to compute paths with the least metro line changes.
- 🗺️ **Real Map Rendering:** GUI built with **html**,**CSS** and **javascript**, using true station coordinates.
- 🧮 **Fare & Distance Calculator:** Computes approximate travel cost based on station hops.(approximation fare) 
- 📂 **Custom Dataset:** Curated and cleaned Delhi Metro data from scratch using ChatGPT and external geolocation sources.
- 🌐 **Logic - integrated** Terminal version written in **C++** upgraded to a graphical one with full **httplib** integration in the web version.

### Problem Statement
Create a real-time metro route pathfinder to visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm. The project simulates Delhi Metro’s functioning with visual clarity and algorithmic accuracy.

### Objectives
- Visualize metro stations and routes accurately
- Find optimal travel paths with respect to:
  - Shortest travel (least stations)
  - Least interchanges (minimum line changes)
- Calculate fare dynamically
- Represent station connectivity and lines with real coordinates and colors
